# Stock Instructor
`Theme = FinTech Education`

# Problem Statement

The world of stock trading can be intimidating and confusing, especially for new traders who may not be familiar with technical terms and analysis. Many beginner traders use popular platforms to invest in stocks, but may not have the necessary knowledge to effectively analyze and predict stock trends using different indicators and charts. As a result, they may miss out on potential opportunities to make profitable trades and may face some serious losses.

# Solution

To help new traders understand technical terms and analysis related to stock trading, we aim to develop a user-friendly platform that simplifies the process of analyzing and predicting stock trends. Our platform will provide educational resources, including a glossary of technical terms and explanations of different indicators and charts. We will also provide a simple and intuitive interface for traders to input their stock preferences and view the necessary data in a clear and concise manner.

Our platform will focus on making the process of stock analysis and prediction accessible and understandable to beginner traders, while also providing valuable insights and predictions based on a complex algorithm. By empowering new traders with the necessary knowledge and tools, we aim to help them make informed decisions and increase their chances of making profitable trades on platforms.
